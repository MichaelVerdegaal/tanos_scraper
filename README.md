# Description
This is a script meant to scrape vocabulary from [tanos.co.uk](http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/). Furthermore it adds example sentences together for each vocab word. 

The reason this was written is because i wanted to experiment with a large set of jlpt training data locally, and i couldnt really find good sets elsewhere.
